# StreetTailsRescue
This project was created to explore the possibilities of using Vaadin as a 
frontend for simple web applications, specifically for the purpose of visualizing data 
on the backend side. 



# Possibilities
*  Users can post announcements about homeless animals they have found.
*  Other users can browse through the posts and find a pet that fits their preferences.
*  Users can upload photos of animals and manage their posts.
*  Administrators can delete users and animals, as well as ban users from the platform.
*  The platform includes features such as registration, authorization, and user confirmation by email.
